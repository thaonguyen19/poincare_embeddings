* Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations of Modules in Common Python Libraries
This repo examines the application of poincaré embedding in encoding the similarity between python modules (e.g. those found in common libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Sklearn), measured by the shortest path in the tree constructed based on the hierarchy of these modules, crawled from Python documentation. Modules with the same name, e.g. "scipy.stats._continuous_distns.lomax_gen.fit" and "sklearn.linear_model.base.LinearModel.fit", are distinguished as different nodes in the tree. During training (multithreaded async SGD), edges connecting modules with the same name are optionally added, with the assumption that the same name signals similar functionality (e.g. estimating the fit of data to a model/ distribution). To evaluate the effectiveness of the representation learned, Pearson correlation is computed for embedding distance versus shortest path distance in the original tree, between nodes that are under the same library (e.g. Numpy).
